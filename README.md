# Dict.cc Fast Translator
I have developed a program which translates words from various languages into other languages with help of dict.cc. Each word which was transated will be saved into a vocabulary file, so you can look which words you often translated. Currently the languages english-german und french-german are implemented.
For transation you must only copy the word to the clipboard and it will be transated automaticly.
You can switch between languages by clicking right on the taskbar entry.
